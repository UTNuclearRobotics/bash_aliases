This repository holds bash alias files commonly used by NRG. These files can be downloaded manually or be used by the automated scripts in the ```nrg_bash``` repository.

The package contains a few classes of alias files, including  
<ul>
  <li>nrg_common_aliases, which holds general-purpose Ubuntu functions.</li>
  <li>Workflows or toolsets, such as catkin_tools_aliases.</li>
  <li>Robot hardware, such as walrus_aliases.</li>
  <li>Specific projects, such as afc_phoenix_aliases.</li>
</ul>

You are encouraged to add and maintain files that are relevant to your work. If you think of an alias that may be useful to people using your robot or joining your project, add it here!
