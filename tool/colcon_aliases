### Aliases & commands for the ROS2 build program colcon

# colcon build, with some useful options set:
# symlink-install: This symbolically links the files in your install space with those in
#                  your src space, so changes to one are reflected in the other.
# packages-skip-build-finished: Skip packages that are already successfully built.
# --parallel-workers N: Maximum number of packages to build at a time (default 12). Reduce N
#                       to reduce your system load while building.
